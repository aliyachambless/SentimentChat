README Assignment 3

Extra Features:

I implemented a real-time typing feature, which shows up on the members list to the left. If a user has not typed a character in 2 seconds, the "typing ..." will go away.

I also implemented an away feature using blur and focus. This also shows up on the members panel.

Finally, I implemented extra credit using the npm sentiment module. I drew a character in 10 different stages of positivity / negativity, and used the module to assess the overall connotation of the messages and change the character displayed. Each message displays the sentiment (if it is not zero) in either red or green depending on the sign. This is implemented using the socket.emit method.

I also worked really hard on the graphics and design and drew all of the assets!
